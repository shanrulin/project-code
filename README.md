Portfolio Optimization by Sector: 
- method 1: maximized the portfolio Sharpe Ratio as objective
- method 2: reformulated objective into a convex programming problem (easy implement in practice)

The code is about method 2 which is convex optimization reformulation.
we first converted the original covariance into a positive definite matrix, then find the optimal solution by using CVX in Matlab
